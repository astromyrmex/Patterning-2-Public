# Patterning-2-Public
A public repository for tracking bugs and making feature requests for Patterning 2.

Use the "Issues" tab above to track bugs and discuss feature requests for Patterning 2.  Please check to see if your bug/request already exists before posting a new one.   

The #bugs tag is for tracking bugs.  
If you want to help out, #help-wanted tag is for bugs where I might need help tracking it down.

The #feature-request tag is for feature requests.  Try to keep them realistic and concise, and also understand that feature requests are not always (or even often) able to be implemented.  If adding a feature is going to make the app confusing or add unnecessary complexity, it probably doesn't fit within the design goals of the app.  So please keep that in mind if you are making feature requests.  That said, post away!
